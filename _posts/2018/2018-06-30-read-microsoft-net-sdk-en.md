`Project` node starts to support the `Sdk` attribute since MSBuild release the 15.0 version which is embedded in Visual Studio 2017. For the `Sdk` attribute, the C# project file whose file extension is csproj becomes much more powerful and extensible.

We'll try to read the source code of `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` which is the default Sdk value of C#.NET project and try to write some creative extension of compiling.

## Where to find the source code of Microsoft.NET.Sdk

Search `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` using [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/) or [Wox](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox), I find that multiple versions are installed in my computer. As I've installed the .NET Core 2.1, the location of my latest version is `C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk\3.0.100-preview6-012264`. The official document [How to: Reference an MSBuild Project SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk?wt.mc_id=MVP) says that if you implement your own Sdk, you can also push it to <nuget.org>.

The NuGet part of `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` is on GitHub:

- [NuGet.Client/src/NuGet.Core at dev · NuGet/NuGet.Client](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/tree/dev/src/NuGet.Core)

## The folder structure of Microsoft.NET.Sdk

When clicking into the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` folder, we can find that the folder structure is very similar to the NuGet folder structure.

I've written some posts talking about the NuGet folder structure but unfortunately they are all not in English:

- [How to Write a Cross-Platform NuGet Tool Package Base on MSBuild Task](/post/create-a-cross-platform-msbuild-task-based-nuget-tool)
- [How to Write a Cross-Platform NuGet Tool Package Base on Command Line Application](/post/create-a-cross-platform-command-based-nuget-tool)

Microsoft have some official document talking about the NuGet folder structure [How to create a NuGet package from a convention-based working directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package#from-a-convention-based-working-directory?wt.mc_id=MVP).

**But** there exists an extra `Sdk` folder for the `Sdk` kind of NuGet package.

![The extra Sdk folder](/static/posts/2018-06-30-21-10-19.png)

The `Sdk.props` file and the `Sdj.targets` file will be imported by default and Microsoft's official document also mentions it here: [How to: Reference an MSBuild Project SDK - Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk?wt.mc_id=MVP). It says that the two code blocks are actually the same:

> ```xml
> <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
>     <PropertyGroup>
>         <TargetFramework>net46</TargetFramework>
>     </PropertyGroup>
> </Project>
> ```

> ```xml
> <Project>
>     <!-- Implicit top import -->
>     <Import Project="Sdk.props" Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk" />
> 
>     <PropertyGroup>
>         <TargetFramework>net46</TargetFramework>
>     </PropertyGroup>
> 
>     <!-- Implicit bottom import -->
>     <Import Project="Sdk.targets" Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk" />
> </Project>
> ```

Because of the default importation behavior, Sdk can do variaty of tasks when MSBuild or Roslyn build the .NET projects. The default Sdk `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` is very extensible so that we can easily use it to customize out compiling behavior and I've mentioned these in the two non-English posts above.

## The major targets of Microsoft.NET.Sdk

I try to search `Target` node in the whole `Sdk` folder and find out 174 `Target`s. Don't worry about the huge `Target` amount because most of them are private by indicating the name with a `_` prefix and some of them have the same name to override and wait to be overridden.

So the core compiling `Target` is not so many and I pick up some core `Target` here:

- `CollectPackageReferences`: Collect the `PackageReference` items to resolve the package dependencies of the project.
- `CoreCompile` The core compiling `Target`.

- `GenerateAssemblyInfo`: Generate the `AssemblyInfo.cs` file which is usually written by developers manually before .NET Core published.
- `Pack`: Pack current project into a NuGet package file whose extension is nupkg.
- `GenerateNuspec`: Generate the nuspec file which is the meta info of the NuGet package.

## Write creative extensions of compiling

I also find some creative `Target` that inspires me:

```xml
<Target Name="DontRestore" BeforeTargets="Restore">
  <Error Text="This project should not be restored" />
 </Target>
```

▲ If a `Restore` target exists, then report a compiling error.

```xml
<Target Name="ReferenceStaticLegacyPackage" BeforeTargets="CollectPackageReferences">
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Remove="LiteDB" />
    <PackageReference Include="LiteDB" Version="2.0.2" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Target>
```

▲ This is written by me to prevent a specific package named `LiteDB` to be upgrade. I post this method in [my another non-English post](/post/prevent-nuget-package-upgrade).
