It is well-known that `mklink` is a command to create a variety of links on NTFS disk. But if you don't know much about it or even never hear of it, it doesn't matter because you know shortcuts at least. This post help you to lean more about `mklink` and know the differences among the difference command options.

## Different ways of linking

Windows Vista announced the NTFS symbolic links, Windows 2000 began to have NTFS Reparse Point, and earlier Windows 95 introduced the shortcut. Backing to Windows 3.5 There are hard links. All of them provide you the power to access a same folder or file in difference paths.

### `mklink`

Using `mklink` command, you can create a "hard link", "junction points" and "symbolic link".

```powershell
> mklink
Creates a symbolic link.

MKLINK [[/D] | [/H] | [/J]] Link Target

        /D      Creates a directory symbolic link.  Default is a file
                symbolic link.
        /H      Creates a hard link instead of a symbolic link.
        /J      Creates a Directory Junction.
        Link    Specifies the new symbolic link name.
        Target  Specifies the path (rel
```

e.g:

```powershell
mklink /J current %APPDATA%\walterlv\packages\1.0.0
```

That is to create a junction point linking to `%APPDATA%\walterlv\packages\1.0.0`.

### Shortcuts

Shortcuts is a Windows feature which is different to those introduced by the NTFS.

Shortcut is a file with a `lnk` file extension. This file contains the info indicates how to open the linking file or directory. Maybe most applications use this `lnk` file to execute their programs.

### Others

Reparse Point has been in the Windows operating system since NTFS v3.0 (introduced with Windows 2000). In addition to our previously mentioned three types of reparse points made by `mklink`, there are other types:

- Volume Mount Ppoints
- Distributed Link Tracking（DLT）
- Data Deduplication
- Hierarchical Storage Management（HSM）
- Native Structured Storage（NSS）
- Unix Doman Socket（socket）
- System Compression
- OneDrive

## Comparison

Reading those words above, you may know the usage of `mklink` but don't know the difference between them. Then I've post them below:

`[Tip1]`: A post of Microsoft says, Starting with Windows 10 Insiders build 14972, symlinks can be created without needing to elevate the console as administrator. This will allow developers, tools and projects, that previously struggled to work effectively on Windows due to symlink issues, to behave just as efficiently and reliably as they do on Linux or OSX. (Below picture shows how to open the developer's mode.)

## Extras

If you create shortcuts in your start menu, and the shortcuts are linking to files that are in junction points. All the shortcuts will disappear after a Windows 10 updates. I'm reporting this bug to Microsoft, but before Microsoft resolve this bug we have to work around to avoid this bug. See the bug in scoop below:
